In our case, all twenty examined variables scale upwards from zero. (In the original ESS survey the three questions regarding immigration were scaled from 1 to 4. For consistency, these have been flipped and shifted so that the variables scale from 0 to 3.) For our radar charts, the higher a response is, the further away the point in the plot will be from the origin. Thus, if one gave the maximal response to each question, their results would show as a circle in the radar plots.",
